## Dosis Font
by Edgar Tolentino, Pablo Impallari, Igino Marini

## Description
Dosis is a very simple, rounded, sans serif family.
The lighter weights are minimalist. The bolder weights have more personality. The medium weight is nice and balanced.
The overall result is a family that's clean and modern, and can express a wide range of voices & feelings.
It's also full of alternate glyphs so you can play arround and have fun.

It comes in 7 weights: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold & ExtraBold
